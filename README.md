# ZebraFinchClassification

Code list used in Zebra Finch Song Classification Project in Jon Sakata`s Lab. Brief description of files and dependencies are provided.

1) Batch_sim : A matlab script for importing batches of song from a folder and converting them into a format so that hctsa toolbox can operate on it. Needs the `batch.txt` file generated by `drif` command. For additional information of hctsa toolbox refer to Instruction.docx

2) Batch_sim_split : Script operates similar to Batch_sim and additionally splits the songs into windows for faster opration by hctsa toolbox. Splits each song twice once starting from the inital data value and the next one starting from half of the window size considered. Needs the `batch.txt` file generated by `drif` command.

3) Plot_segments : Script file for plotting the segmented song based on color codes whcih are proportional to the prediction probabilities obtained from a linear SVM classifier trained on features extracted from the songs. ``TS_classify_label`` of hctsa has been slightly modified and can be found in this repository.

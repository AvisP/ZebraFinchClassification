ConvNet.py - Script trains a Convolutional Neural Network on The Recurrenece Plot of the song files.

ConvNet.py_Spectral.py - Script trains a Convolutional Neural network on the Spectrogram Images of the song files.

DataExtraction.py - Script for reading through all the song (audio) files in the folder, generate labels based on the names assigned to each file, convert each audio file to a spectrogram image or recurrence plot. 

SpecGram_plot_modified.py - Modified version of a script as obtained from the repository https://github.com/titu1994/MLSTM-FCN. It contains some functions that generates spectrogram image of a timeseries data.

layers_utils.py - Script as obtained from repository https://github.com/titu1994/MLSTM-FCN  . It defines a custom AttentionLSTM class that has been used for in the convolutional neural network model
